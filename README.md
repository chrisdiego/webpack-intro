Learning the basics of webpack

This repo was made following the 'Getting Started' documentation on webpack.js.org:
https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started

It doesn't really render anything, but it does go over the process of setting up a webpack configuration file.
I found the portion covering how to use webpack-dev-middleware and webpack-hot-middleware especially useful.

https://webpack.js.org/guides/development#using-webpack-dev-middleware
https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-hot-middleware

The setup for the middleware potion of the config can be seen in ./webpack.config.js and ./server.js
